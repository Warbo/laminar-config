# Warbo's Laminar Configuration #

Laminar is a simple continuous integration server. Laminar jobs are just scripts
which live in a particular directory, which this repository provides.

We don't point Laminar directly at this git repository, since the scripts might
need a variety of dependencies, etc. which might even conflict (e.g. if jobs
need different versions of GHC). Instead we define the jobs directory as a Nix
package, which lets us manage each script's dependencies independently.

## Contents ##

The `default.nix` file defines the job directory package. Build it using e.g.
`nix-build`.

The `install` script builds the job directory and points Laminar at the result.
